# Car Testing Program

Hello, My name is Joebeck Andrew F. Gusi from BSCPE 1-5.

The car class, which this program implements, provides an object of a car with the ability to accelerate, 
decelerate, and obtain the current speed. The program creates a Car object and calls its methods to show how to use the Car class. 

Thank you for using my program!!
