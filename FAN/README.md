# Fan Testing Program

Hello, My name is Joebeck Andrew F. Gusi from BSCPE 1-5.


The repository itself contains a Python code of the Fan class along with a test file to show how to use it. 
The Fan class offers a number of ways to interact with a fan's characteristics and serves as a representation of a fan.

Fan Class:
The Fan.py file defines the Fan class.

Testing File:
The TestFan.py file contains the testing program's implementation. 
It makes two instances of the Fan class and uses its methods to show how they work. 
Additionally, it shows the characteristics of the fans in a straightforward GUI window as well as in the console output.

Use Python to run the TestFan.py file in order to run the testing software. Two separate Fan objects with different configurations 
will be created by the application, and their properties will be shown.


An overview of the Fan class and testing program may be found in this README file. 
Check the Fan.py file for comprehensive information about the class implementation. 
Run the TestFan.py file to observe the testing file in action.


Thank you for using my program!!
