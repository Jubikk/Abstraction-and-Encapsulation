# Abstraction-and-Encapsulation

What is Abstraction?
	The technique of abstracting complex real-world phenomena into more manageable models is done in computer programs. 
	It emphasizes on keeping the user informed of only the most important characteristics while suppressing all other information.
	Without revealing implementation specifics, abstraction enables you to design abstract classes or interfaces that define a common 
	structure or behavior. The Python abc module allows you to implement abstraction using abstract base classes. Abstract base classes 
	specify abstract methods that concrete subclasses must implement.


What is Encapsulation?
	A class's internal data and methods are hidden through encapsulation, which also controls access through public methods. 
	It aids in attaining data privacy and hinders unauthorized external parties from directly accessing or changing internal 
	implementation specifics. Encapsulation is commonly accomplished in Python by defining private and public properties and 
	methods with access modifiers (often denoted by underscores).
