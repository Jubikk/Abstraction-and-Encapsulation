# Pet Testing Program

Hello, My name is Joebeck Andrew F. Gusi from BSCPE 1-5.

This is an easy-to-understand illustration of how the Python Pet class operates.

Class.py:
It contains the 'Pet' class code along with methods for setting and retrieving data about pets.

Test.py:
A program that generates an object of the 'Pet' class, asks the user for information about the pet, 
and then uses the accessor methods on the object to show the information.

Thank you for using my program!!
